<h2>ENGL 367 Fall 2019</h2>
<h2 id="course-description">Course description</h2>
<p><em>“What connexion can there have been between many people in the innumerable histories of this world who from opposite sides of great gulfs have, nevertheless, been very curiously brought together!”</em></p>
<p>Charles Dickens posed this rhetorical question — why even bother with a question mark! — in his 1857 novel <em>Bleak House</em>. Being British, he naturally spelled <em>connexion</em> as the British do, putting a visual symbol of connectedness, the letter <em>x</em>, right there in the middle of the word.</p>
<p>During the Victorian period in England (roughly, 1837-1901), many forces were at work to make humanity more “connected” than it had ever been before. The growth of cities and the development of new modes of transportation and communication brought people closer geographically and intellectually. Advances in scientific knowledge made it possible for them to better grasp their connection to other living things. The ascendancy of a new market form — industrial capitalism — together with its attendant new political form — imperialism — created a new sense of global connectedness.</p>
<p>Yet these very same forces often seemed to operate as sources of <em>disconnection</em>, alienating people from each other, dividing society into unequal and mutually antagonistic classes, breeding oppressive and inhumane forms of behavior at home and abroad, breaking the continuity between past and present, disrupting belief systems that had given life meaning.</p>
<p>In this course, we’ll follow the ideas of connection and disconnection through a selection of Victorian fiction, poetry, and prose.</p>
<p>And we’ll try to do this in a way that fosters a sense of connectedness and community among ourselves.</p>
