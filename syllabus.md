## Course description

> "What connexion can there have been between many people in the innumerable histories of this world who from opposite sides of great gulfs have, nevertheless, been very curiously brought together!"

Charles Dickens posed this rhetorical question — why even bother with a question mark! — in his 1857 novel *Bleak House*. 

During the Victorian period in England (roughly, 1832-1901), many forces were at work to make humanity more "connected" than it had ever been before. The growth of cities, the development of new modes of transportation and new modes of communication brought people closer than they had ever been before. Advances in scientific knowledge made it possible for them to better grasp their connection to other living things. The ascendancy of a new market form — industrial capitalism — together with its attendant new political form — imperialism — created a new sense of global connectedness. 

Yet these very same forces often seemed to operate as sources of *disconnection*, alienating people from each other, dividing society into unequal and mutually antagonistic classes, breeding oppressive and inhumane forms of behavior at home and abroad, breaking the continuity between past and present, disrupting belief systems that had given life meaning.

In this course, we'll follow the ideas of connection and disconnection through a selection of Victorian fiction, poetry, and prose.

And we'll try to do this in a way that fosters a sense of connectedness and community among ourselves.

### IV. Connected species

*Even before Charles Darwin published his theory of evolution by natural selection in 1859, new ideas about the origins and development of life created a whole new way to undertand humanity's connection to the rest of nature and the present's connection to the past.

### V. Connected lives

*What makes all the different things we do, and all the things that are done to us, feel like they make up a single, continuous, connected whole: a life?
