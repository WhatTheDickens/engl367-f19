# Course description

> "What connexion can there have been between many people in the innumerable histories of this world who from opposite sides of great gulfs have, nevertheless, been very curiously brought together!"

Charles Dickens posed this rhetorical question — why even bother with a question mark! — in his 1857 novel *Bleak House*. 

During the Victorian period in England (roughly, 1832-1901), many forces were at work to make humanity more "connected" than it had ever been before. The growth of cities, the development of new modes of transportation (e.g., the railroad) and new modes of communication (e.g., the telegraph) brought people closer than they had ever been before. Advances in scientific knowledge made it possible for them to better grasp their connection to other living things. The ascendancy of a new market form — industrial capitalism — together with its attendant new political form — imperialism — created a new sense of global connectedness. 

Yet these very same forces often seemed to operate as sources of *disconnection*, alienating people from each other, dividing society into unequal and mutually antagonistic "classes," breeding oppressive and inhuman forms of behavior at home and abroad, breaking the continuity between past and present, disrupting belief systems that had given life meaning.

Our course won't be a comprehensive survey of Victorian literature. Instead, we'll follow the ideas of connection and disconnection through a selection of Victorian fiction, poetry, and prose.

And we'll try to do this in a way that fosters and takes advantage of our connections with each other. 

# Syllabus

## Schedule

### I. Introduction

We'll spend the first week of class getting connected to each other and familiarizing ourselves with some tools designed to help us collaborate. 

Our goal will not be to discover who knows the most or writes the best. Instead, it will be to work together to improve everyone's understanding of the course material and everyone's ability to think critically and communicate effectively about literature.

### IV. Connected species

*Even before Charles Darwin published his theory of evolution by natural selection in 1859, new ideas about the origins and development of life created a whole new way to undertand humanity's connection to the rest of nature and the present's connection to the past.

### V. Connected lives

*What makes all the different things we do, and all the things that are done to us, feel like they make up a single, continuous, connected whole: a life? What "connexion" can there be between lives that, on the surface, seem to move on separate tracks? What forces of disconnection in Victorian life moved Charles Dickens to ask these questions, and what did he want his readers to learn from the answers?
